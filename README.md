# Clean React

ReactJS system using Hooks, Recoil, with a well defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (Test Driven Development) as a work methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsabilities in layers, always following the SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS principles and applying Design Patterns to solve common problems.

### Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Separation of Concerns (SOC)
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
- Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)
- Composition Over Inheritance
- Small Commits
